# Getting Started with Luxon

This repo has some examples of things I learned to do with [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) as an alternative to [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

This is also the companion to my video [Using Luxon for JavaScript Dates and Times](https://youtu.be/zIRSdTKyPS4);

## Setup

If you want to use Luxon with Node projects:

```bash
npm install luxon
```

If you want to use locals (time based on specific zone):

```bash
npm install luxon
npm install full-icu

# set environment variable for project
# NODE_ICU_DATA="$(pwd)/node_modules/full-icu"
```
